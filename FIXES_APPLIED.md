# 🔧 Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Removed Incorrect "install" Package
- **Problem:** An incorrect `"install": "^0.13.0"` package was added to dependencies
- **Fix:** Removed from package.json and uninstalled

### 2. ✅ Fixed AJV Dependency Issue
- **Problem:** `ajv-keywords` was incompatible with the installed `ajv` version
- **Error:** `Cannot find module 'ajv/dist/compile/codegen'`
- **Fix:** Installed compatible versions:
  - `ajv@^8.12.0`
  - `ajv-keywords@^5.1.0`

### 3. ✅ Fixed DateTimePicker Version
- **Problem:** Version 8.x requires Expo 52+, but we're using Expo 51
- **Fix:** Downgraded to `7.6.2` (compatible with Expo 51)

### 4. ✅ Fixed Expo Image Picker Version
- **Problem:** Version `~15.0.14` doesn't exist
- **Fix:** Changed to `~15.0.0` (correct for Expo 51)

## 📝 Note

The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required for installation due to some peer dependency conflicts that don't affect functionality. This is normal for React Native projects with many dependencies.
