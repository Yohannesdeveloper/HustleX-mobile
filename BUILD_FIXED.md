# ✅ Build Issue Fixed!

## Problem Identified
The Android build was failing because your project had a **hybrid setup** mixing:
- ❌ **Capacitor** native code (for web apps)
- ✅ **Expo/React Native** (for mobile apps)

EAS Build couldn't handle the Capacitor dependencies in the Android Gradle files.

## Solution Applied

### 1. ✅ Regenerated Native Code with Expo Prebuild
Ran `npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android` which:
- Removed old Capacitor-based Android code
- Generated proper Expo React Native Android configuration
- Created correct `build.gradle` files for Expo

### 2. ✅ Verified Configuration
- ✅ Root `build.gradle` - Proper Expo/React Native setup
- ✅ `app/build.gradle` - Now uses Expo React Native (no Capacitor)
- ✅ `settings.gradle` - Proper Expo autolinking
- ✅ `gradle.properties` - Optimized for Expo builds

## 🚀 Ready to Build!

Your Android native code is now properly configured for Expo EAS Build. Try building again:

```bash
npm run build:android:preview
```

This should work now because:
- ✅ No more Capacitor dependencies in Android code
- ✅ Proper Expo React Native Gradle configuration
- ✅ EAS Build can now process the native code correctly

## What Changed?

**Before:**
- `android/app/build.gradle` had Capacitor dependencies
- References to `:capacitor-android` project
- Capacitor-specific build configuration

**After:**
- `android/app/build.gradle` uses Expo React Native
- Proper React Native Gradle plugin
- Expo autolinking configured
- Standard Expo build process

## Next Steps

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:android:preview
   ```

2. **If successful**, you'll get an APK download link

3. **For production builds:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:android
   ```
   (This creates an AAB for Google Play Store)

## Note About Capacitor

If you were using Capacitor for web features, you can still use it for web builds, but the mobile native code now uses Expo/React Native which is the correct setup for EAS Build.
