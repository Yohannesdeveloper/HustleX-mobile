# Build Fix - Gradle Error Resolution

## Issue
The Android build is failing with a Gradle error. This is likely due to:
1. Capacitor/Expo hybrid setup compatibility
2. Gradle configuration issues
3. Missing dependencies or version mismatches

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated EAS Configuration
- Added explicit Gradle commands to `eas.json`
- Configured for bare workflow with native code

### 2. Optimized Gradle Properties
- Increased memory allocation (2048m)
- Enabled parallel builds and caching

### 3. Updated App Configuration
- Added Android SDK version specifications in `app.json`

## Next Steps to Fix Build

### Option A: Use Expo Prebuild (Recommended)
Since you have native code, try regenerating it with Expo:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build:android:preview
```

### Option B: Check Build Logs
View detailed error logs at:
https://expo.dev/accounts/yohannesfk/projects/hustlex/builds/12c0faa1-447b-4815-9d2c-aab106adc4a8#run-gradlew

Common issues to check:
- Missing dependencies
- Version conflicts
- SDK version compatibility

### Option C: Downgrade Gradle Plugin (If needed)
If the Gradle plugin version is too new, edit `android/build.gradle`:

```gradle
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.5.0'  // Instead of 8.13.0
```

### Option D: Local Build First
Test the build locally to see the exact error:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

This will show you the exact Gradle error that needs to be fixed.

## Alternative: Use Capacitor Build Directly

If EAS Build continues to have issues, you can build directly with Capacitor:

1. **Sync Capacitor:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync android
   ```

2. **Build in Android Studio:**
   - Open `android` folder in Android Studio
   - Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)

This bypasses EAS Build entirely and uses your local Android setup.
