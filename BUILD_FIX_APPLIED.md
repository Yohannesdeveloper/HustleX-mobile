# Build Fix Applied ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Installed Capacitor Dependencies
- Added `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/cli`, `@capacitor/android`, `@capacitor/ios`
- This was the main issue - the Android build was referencing Capacitor but it wasn't installed

### 2. ✅ Synced Capacitor
- Ran `npx cap sync android` to update native Android code
- Ensured all Capacitor plugins are properly linked

### 3. ✅ Optimized Gradle Configuration
- Increased memory allocation to 2048m
- Enabled parallel builds and caching
- Added Android SDK versions to app.json

### 4. ✅ Updated EAS Configuration
- Simplified eas.json to use standard Expo build process
- Removed custom Gradle commands that might conflict

## Next Steps

### Try Building Again:

```bash
npm run build:android:preview
```

The build should now work because:
- ✅ Capacitor dependencies are installed
- ✅ Native code is synced
- ✅ Gradle is optimized
- ✅ EAS is properly configured

### If Build Still Fails:

1. **Check the build logs** at the Expo dashboard for specific errors
2. **Try Expo Prebuild** to regenerate native code:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   npm run build:android:preview
   ```

3. **Alternative: Build Locally** (if EAS continues to have issues):
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

## What Was Wrong?

The Android build was failing because:
- ❌ Capacitor packages were referenced in `android/settings.gradle` but not installed in `package.json`
- ❌ The native Android code expected Capacitor dependencies that didn't exist
- ❌ Gradle couldn't resolve the `:capacitor-android` module

## Status: Ready to Build 🚀

Your project is now properly configured. Try building again!
